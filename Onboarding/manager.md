# Manager Responsibilities
The hiring managers main role is to empower and enable the new hire.

* Empowerment comes in the sense of providing the new hire a living example of HCA’s culture and values. Communicate clearly and concisely what is expected of the new hire. Encourage the culture of curiousity and inclusivness. If a new hire expresses an opinion do not be dismissive it could be a great place for the first contributions. 
* Enable the new hire by making sure he/she has all the equipment necessary to perform their job. If they are an iOS developer make sure they have a mac and test device(s). Make sure he/she has the appropriate accesses to all required systems the first day they arrive. Some examples:
    * Administrative:
        * Planview
        * Service Central
    * Project:
        * Jira
        * TFS
        * Github Enterprise

Craft an onboarding plan for the newhire. One of the first tasks of creating the onboard plan is to select and assign a mentor for the new hire. You should work with the mentor to accommodate mentorship work. You can use the mentor to help create the benchmark assessments later in the onboarding plan. The intent of these assements is to give you an indication the effectiveness of our onboarding process.
