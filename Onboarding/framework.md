# Onboarding Framework
The onboarding framework is a general guide to crafting the onboarding plan. This document is targeted towards hiring managers. You can find an example of a full onboarding plan [here]().

## Why do we document plans?
The importance of documenting and chronicling the new hire journey here at HCA isn't just for the new hire. By creating a thoughtful onboarding experience we: 
* ensure that we are meeting new hire expectations
* recruit and retain top talent
* create culture of contribution and efficiency
* bring HCA core values and mission statement into onboarding process
We chronicle the onboarding process so that we may measure our effectiveness of onboarding new employees. With these measurements we can articulate progress towards organizational goals.

## General flow
The hiring manager, in his/her own words, should have a few things documented in every onboarding plan:
* [the expectations of the new hire ](new-hire.md)
* [the expectations of the mentor](/mentor.md)
* [responsibilities of the manager](/manager.md)
* [timeline with benchmarks defined](/timeline.md) 
* definition of success


## Benchmark timeline template
You can find an example timeline [here](/timeline.md). The following two are actual templates that you can use during the creation of the current plan:
* [Excel Timeline]()
* [Numbers Timeline](resources/on-boarding-timeline.numbers)

Notice that in the two above there are a few benchmarks in the beginning of the timeline. These benchmarks should be included in every plan, these are directly correlated organizational goals. Please do not alter them. 

As you are adding benchmarks be mindful of scheduled holidays and any other influences that may impact the plan. Make sure that your expectations of the new hire are reasonable, It’s ok if you need to move some of the benchmarks around if some of the goals aren’t quite right at first.

## Submission of your onboarding plan
It is imperative that the plan be submitted before the new hire’s start date. This doesn’t mean that the plan can’t be altered, just that if it is altered that it be documented why so that our data isn’t skewed. For now the onboarding plan is a series of documents tied together. There are plans to have a web tool by which to submit the onboarding plan.
