# Mentor Responsibilities
As a mentor you are critical to the onboarding process. You serve as the new hire's main advisor and assist the new hire in becoming a productive member of the team. It’s your manager’s and your responsibility to ensure that accommodations are made with incorporating mentorship activities with project work. During the onboarding you’ll:

* Present “HCA Data Flow”. This presentation describes how data flows throughout HCA from its source all the way to end applications. It will also define various terms used to talk about data. 
* Present any documentation on team work flow and the software development life cycle. 
* Never miss an opportunity to introduce the new hire to someone on a different team. 
* Assist the new hire in establishing their development environment.
* Take various assessments on the new hire’s progress.
At the end of the official onboarding process you’ll be asked to take a mentor survey, so that we can make sure that we are making mentorship as effective as it can be.
