# Swift (Functional)




## No Emoji

Do not use emoji in your projects. For those readers who actually type in their code, it's an unnecessary source of friction. While it may be cute, it doesn't add to the learning and it interrupts the coding flow for these readers.

## Organization and Bundle Identifier

Where an Xcode project is involved, the organization should be set to `hcahealthcare` and the Bundle Identifier set to `com.hcahealthcare.{AppName}`
