# New Hire Responsibilities
Welcome to HCA! We are excited to have you and look forward to working with you! There are a few things that we ask from you as you are getting settled into work here HCA:


* Be **bold**. If something doesn't make sense, call it out.  <Your opinion is valued. You've been selected to work here, we value expertise from outside the organization.>
* Ask questions. It's a big place and a lot of people. You aren't expected to know everything or everyone but you are expected to ask. When you encounter new people ask who they are, what team they are on and how they contribute to the big picture.
* Read the [engineering principles](/Engineering-Principles/readme). These principles guide our decisions. 


TODO: Find a good article, maybe get senior leader to write a letter to a new engineer.
