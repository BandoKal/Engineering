# Mobile Alerting and Sounds Standard

This document is intended to set guidelines and standards on sounds being emitted from mobile devices at HCA.


## Non-Clinical Environment

Sounds introduced into the non-clinical environment should augment the user experience not disrupt it. When selecting sounds, one should ensure that it is appropriate for the goal of the sound alert, ringtone, or alarm. The sounds should be in alignment with the following:

* Sounds should not mimic common emergency sounds or sirens.
* Sounds should be considered professional in nature
* Sounds should be different enough from existing system sounds that they would be unlikely to be confused
* Sounds should be in the WAV 44.1k 16 bit format as it is lossless, is usable by both Windows and Macintosh computers, and can be easily converted into other formats as needed going forward
* Sounds should maximize the available headroom making them as loud as they can be while remaining uniform to the other sounds in the app, without sounding distorted on the device
* For applications that support multiple alert levels, sounds should have different versions that indicate increasing levels of alert


## Clinical Environment

Sounds introduced into the clinical environment should follow the non-clinical standards in addition to the following:

* Sounds should be different enough from medical equipment alerting sounds that they would be unlikely to be confused
* Sounds should be able to cut through noisy environments
* Sounds should be still be effective when the device is in a pocket
* Haptics should be used in addition to sound
